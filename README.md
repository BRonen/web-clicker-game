# Clicker Game

This game is made with React, full typed in typescript and state managed made with @redux/toolkit. The idea for this game was just a poc in vanilla js in a boring class, but it turned out to be a really good project to learn about state management and redux in react and stylization with stitches.

A pretty cool backend is coming soonA really cool backend will be there someday...
